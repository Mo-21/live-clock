# Simple Clock Project

This project is a simple clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in both analog and digital formats, and allows you to switch between light and dark themes.

## Features

- Analog Clock: The analog clock has hour, minute, and second hands that move in real time.
- Digital Clock: The digital clock displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
- Date: The current date is displayed below the clocks.
- Theme Switcher: A button allows you to switch between light and dark themes.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The current time will be displayed in both analog and digital formats.
3. Click the "Theme" button to switch between light and dark themes.

## Code Overview

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the clocks and the theme switcher button.

## Future Improvements
